Certainly! Below is a detailed `README.md` file that explains loops in Java, covering `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, including theory, syntax, examples, and a comparison table. You can include this in your Git repository to provide comprehensive information about loops in Java.

# Loops in Java

In Java, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met. There are three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. Each type has its own use cases and syntax.

## For Loop

### Purpose:
The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

### Syntax:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization**: Initializes the loop counter. The initialization statement is executed once at the beginning of the loop.
- **Condition**: Evaluates if the loop should continue running. If `false`, the loop terminates.
- **Update**: Updates the loop counter after each iteration.
- **Example**: [click-me](/fundamentals/loops/ForLoopExample.java)

## While Loop

### Purpose:
The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

### Syntax:
```java
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

- **Condition**: Checked before each iteration. If `false`, the loop terminates.
- **Example**: [click-me](/fundamentals/loops/WhileLoopExample)

## Do-While Loop

### Purpose:
The `do-while` loop is used when the block of code needs to be executed at least once.

### Syntax:
```java
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

- **Execution**: The code block is executed first.
- **Condition**: Checked after each iteration. If `false`, the loop terminates.
- **Example**: [click-me](/fundamentals/loops/)

|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Initialization | Executes only once at the start            | No initialization in loop header   | No initialization in loop header   |
| Condition      | Checked at the start of each iteration     | Checked before each iteration      | Checked after each iteration       |
| Execution      | Executes zero or more times                | Executes zero or more times        | Executes one or more times         |
| Use case       | Known number of iterations                 | Unknown number of iterations      | Executes at least once             |

### Conclusion

Each type of loop has its own use case, and the choice of loop depends on the specific requirements of your program. By understanding these differences, you can effectively choose the appropriate loop construct for your needs.
